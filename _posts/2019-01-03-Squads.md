This project was mainly to play around with deckgl (ubers open source data visualization framework) and I came across this excellent package for using it with R[**mapdeck**](https://github.com/SymbolixAU/mapdeck), it also contains graphs made using [**highcharts**](http://jkunst.com/highcharter/) and [**gganimate**](https://github.com/thomasp85/gganimate).
