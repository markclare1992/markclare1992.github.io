## Why
Opta provide weather code's for matches that give basic weather information, I decided to try and add futher data to that.

### Location
To get weather data you need location information, using the ([**google maps api**](https://github.com/googlemaps/google-maps-services-python))
we can get longitude, latitude and altitude data for stadiums.
Below is a quick histogram of the some location data (altitude) of stadiums.

### Temperature
Weather data can now be collected using the ([**darksky api**](https://darksky.net/dev))
Below you can see some temperature and weather condition data.
The coldest game for 2017-18 was Dortmund vs Augsburg on the 26th February 2018, with the temperature being -4.58°C and the warmest being Leganes vs Alaves on the 18th August 2017 with the temperature being 33.3°C.

### Pitch Size
Using various wikipedia python packages you can add data (very unclean data) from infoboxes.
Below you can see pitch dimension data for some Premier League stadiums (accuracy unknown).

### Further Analysis
Things I intend to look at if I get the time.
- Validation - Original temperature plot had a premier league game kicking off in -25°C (issues with ambiguous venue names with googlemapsapi)
- Effect of weather/temperature on various football events.
- Effect of pitch size/surface on various football events (wikipedia data needs cleaning and verifying properly first)

Code used for above and visualizations is ([**here**](https://github.com/markclare1992/stadium_details))
