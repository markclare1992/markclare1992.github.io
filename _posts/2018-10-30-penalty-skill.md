## Penalties
As soon as Riyad Mahrez missed his penalty against Liverpool, the commentators were already questioning whether he was the right man to have taken it.  After-timing aside, do they have a point? He had missed his previous 2 attempts, is there anything we can learn from this or is it too small a sample size?

## Averages
The table below shows the breakdown of all the penalties in my database.

| Outcome | %   |
|---------|:----|
|Goal     |0.757|
|Miss/Save|0.243|
