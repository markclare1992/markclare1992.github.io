## Conventional Wisdom
The public analytics community as a whole assign a value of 0.76 XG ([**explained**](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40699431)) to a penalty. Is this correct? <br />
*(Disclaimer: I will not be going into the issue of whether or not penalties should be included in single game summaries or timelines)*

### Origin
With a large dataset it is fairly easy to compute a quick estimate for how likely it is that a penalty will result in a goal.  Looking at the outcome of penalties awarded, excluding penalty shootouts (they're converted at a different rate), we can see where the widely used figure of 0.76 comes from.

| Type       	| Total         | %  	|
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Goal    	| 6340		| 0.7596|
| Saved		| 1492		| 0.1788|    
| Missed	| 289		| 0.0346|
| Post		| 225		| 0.0270|

### Improvement
I was watching a game recently and this happened, it led me to think about how often do these chances arise, and how good a chance are they?

## Penalty Rebounds
### Definition
I denote a shot to be a penalty rebound if:

> The shot occurs directly after a penalty that is either saved or hits the post.  It is the first action taken by the same team after the penalty (i.e no passes made).

I also chose to log the time between the taking of the penalty and the penalty rebound for sanity checking purposes.

### Validation

There is a total of 368 "penalty rebounds" in my dataset.  Looking at the histogram above, the majority of the time_to_rebound's fall within a reasonable bound, there are a few entries > 10 seconds which look suspicious.
Looking one of the entries with a large time_to_rebound (11 seconds), you can see that a penalty rebound does occur, and the time logging of when the penalty is taken may be the issue.

The locations of the rebounds intuitively make sense too, however there are a few points around the x=70 position that look questionable.
Once again looking at a rebound with one of the most extreme x positions, we can be confident that this fits the description of a penalty rebound.

### Summary Statistics
Looking at the whole set of penalty rebounds gives the summary stats below.

| Number       	| Min. Time to rebound	| Max Time to rebound	| Mean XG per shot	| Mean Goals per shot	|
| ------------- |:---------------------:|----------------------:|----------------------:|----------------------:|	
|368		| 0			| 13			| 0.327			| 0.416			|

I was suprised by the 8% difference between my model and the actual outcome of the penalty rebounds.  I was expecting it to be much greater than this, due to:
- Keeper being grounded, or very recently grounded.
- Much less likely for defenders to be inbetween the shooter & the goal than any other normal shot.

### Improvement

The 8% difference between outcome & prediction is still fairly significant.
I re-trained the XG model with penalty rebound as a feature (only 368 shots out of a total of over 70,000 shots).
The newly trained model predicted a mean XG per shot of 0.38 for the penalty rebounds, and had a miniscule improvement over the old model in terms of its RMSE (root mean squared error).

<figure class='single'>
	<a href="/assets/images/penalty/prob_tree.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/penalty/prob_tree.jpg"></a>
</figure>

Following the tree above, and using the XG model value of 0.38 for a penalty rebound, a penalty results in a goal in 0.76 + (0.2 x 0.215 x 0.38) = 77.6%

### Note

Using 0.78 as the estimated value for a penalty awarded only makes sense if any shots that would be classified as a penalty rebound are removed too.
