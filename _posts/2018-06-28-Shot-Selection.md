## Shot location
I wanted to look at whether teams take shots from different locations depending on what the current score is, I was also interested to see if how chances are created change based on this too.
Removing penalties from the dataset and plotting the average locations for shots gave the plot below.

## Shot generation
Does the way shots are generated change depending on the current score?

## Caveats
There is the possibility that good teams are more likely to be in a positive game state, and that they might be good teams because they take better shots and because they can advance the ball to better areas.
