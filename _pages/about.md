Sports trader with an interest in data science & programming, using online courses and self learning to improve my skills.  The site will share posts & projects mainly revolving around football.
Analysis & visualisation will be done using software including;
Python, RStudio, MongoDB & D3.

## Personal Betting
- Majority of betting done on early asian handicap football markets & long term football markets.
- Ratings for major European leagues using both XG & non-XG models, both for short term bets above and long term bets.
- Use of API's for notifications & pricing.
- Player specific databases used for further bets.
- Python & selenium used for web scraping, MongoDB used as the database, private Github repo's for version control.
- Shiny app's used for calculations. 

## Footbal Trader
### Spreadex
#### September 2015 - Present
- Web scraping to maintain databases relevant for pricing (using Rvest & tidyverse).
- Shiny app development to simplify pricing process (using shiny & ggplot).
- Various short term ratings for top all leagues (using caret & Rstan).
- Long term pricing for leagues and tournaments.
- Modelling and pricing of niche markets.
