## Conventional Wisdom
The public analytics community as a whole assign a value of 0.76 XG ([**explained**](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40699431)) to a penalty. Is this correct? <br />
*(Disclaimer: I will not be going into the issue of whether or not penalties should be included in single game summaries or timelines)*

### Origin
With a large dataset it is fairly easy to compute a quick estimate for how much a penalty is worth.  Looking at the outcome of penalties awarded, excluding penalty shootouts (they're converted at a different rate), we can see where the widely used figure of 0.76 comes from.

| Type       	| Total         | %  	|
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Goal    	| 6340		| 0.7596|
| Saved		| 1492		| 0.1788|    
| Missed	| 289		| 0.0346|
| Post		| 225		| 0.0270|

### Improvement
I was watching a recently and this happened, it led me to think about how often do these chances arise, and how good a chance are they?

## Penalty Rebounds
### Definition
I denote a shot to be a penalty rebound if:

> The shot occurs directly after a penalty that is either saved or hits the post.  It is the first action taken by the same team after the penalty (i.e no passes made).

I also chose to log the time between the taking of the penalty and the penalty rebound for sanity checking purposes.

There is a total of 362 "Penalty rebounds" in my dataset.  Looking at the histogram above, the majority of the time_to_rebound variable fit with your intuition, there are a few entries > 10 seconds which look suspicious.
Looking one of the entries with a large time_to_rebound (11 seconds), here, we can see that a penalty rebound does occur, and the time logging of when the penalty is taken may be the issue.

The locations of the rebounds intuitively make sense too, however once again there are a few points around the x=70 position that look questionable.
Once again looking at a rebound with one of the most extreme x positions, we can be confident that this fits the description of a penalty rebound.
