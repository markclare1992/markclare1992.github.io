####  ([**Data from Opta.**](http://www.optasports.com/ )) 
## Conventional Wisdom
The public analytics community as a whole assign a value of 0.76 XG ([**XG explained**](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40699431)) to a penalty. Is this correct? <br />
*(Disclaimer: I will not be going into the issue of whether or not penalties should be included in single game summaries or timelines)*

### Origin
With a large dataset it is easy to calculate a quick estimate for the probability of a penalty resulting in a goal.  Looking at the outcome of penalties awarded below, excluding penalty shootouts (they're converted at a different rate), we can see where the widely used figure of 0.76 comes from.

| Type       	| Total         | %  	|
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Goal    	| 6340		| 0.7596|
| Saved		| 1492		| 0.1788|    
| Missed	| 289		| 0.0346|
| Post		| 225		| 0.0270|

### Improvement
I was watching a game recently and this happened.  How often do these kind of chances arise, and how likely are they to result in goals?

## Penalty Rebounds
### Definition
I denote a shot to be a penalty rebound if:

> The shot occurs directly after a penalty that is either saved or hits the post.  It is the first action taken by the same team after the penalty (i.e no passes made).

I also chose to log the time between the taking of the penalty and the penalty rebound for sanity checking purposes.

### Validation

There is a total of 368 "penalty rebounds" in my dataset.  Looking at the histogram above, the majority of the time_to_rebound's fall within a reasonable bound, there are a few entries > 10 seconds that look suspicious.
Looking at one of the entries with a large time_to_rebound (11 seconds), a penalty rebound does occur and the actual time_to_rebound is less than the 11 seconds.

The locations of the rebounds intuitively make sense too, however there are a few points around the x=70 position that look questionable.
Once again looking at a rebound with one of the most extreme x co-ordinates (x=71, y=58), we can be confident that this fits the description of a penalty rebound.

### Summary Statistics
Looking at the whole set of penalty rebounds gives the summary statistics below.

| #	| Mean XG/shot	| Mean Goals/shot	| Mean error	| Mean absolute error	|RMSE	|
| ----- |--------------:|----------------------:|--------------:|----------------------:|------:|
|368	| 0.33		| 0.42			| 0.089		| 0.35			| 0.42	|

([**Mean absolute error & RMSE explained**](https://medium.com/human-in-a-machine-world/mae-and-rmse-which-metric-is-better-e60ac3bde13d)) <br />
I was surprised by the errors between the model predictions and the actual outcome of the penalty rebounds.  I was expecting them to be much greater, due to:
- Keeper being grounded, or very recently grounded.
- Much less likely for defenders to be in-between the shooter & the goal than any other normal shot.

### Improvement

I re-trained the XG model using penalty rebound as a feature (368 shots out of a total of over 70,000 shots).
The newly trained model predicted a mean XG per shot of 0.38 for the penalty rebounds, and had a minuscule improvement over the old model in terms of its RMSE for both the penalty rebound shots, and also all shots.
Summary statistics for the new model are shown below.

| #	| Mean XG/shot	| Mean Goals/shot	| Mean error	| Mean absolute error	|RMSE	|
| ----- |--------------:|----------------------:|--------------:|----------------------:|------:|
|368	| 0.38		| 0.42			| 0.037		| 0.35			| 0.41	|

<figure class='single'>
	<a href="/assets/images/penalty/prob_tree.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/penalty/prob_tree.jpg"></a>
</figure>

Following the tree above, and using the XG model value of 0.38 for a penalty rebound, a penalty results in a goal in 78% of occurrences.
> 0.76 + (0.2 x 0.215 x 0.38) = 77.6% 

### Note

Using 0.78 as the estimated value for a penalty awarded only makes sense if any shots that would be classified as a penalty rebound are removed too.
